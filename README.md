## Introduction
This application is a team project for Data Mining Course assessment, tailored for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding and applying data mining techniques in the domains of Clustering, Association Rules, and Classification.

## Purpose of the Application
The Data Mining Learning Application serves as a practical platform where users can:

- Explore Basic Algorithms: Learn the mechanics of key data mining algorithms by interacting with them directly.
- Visualize Data and Results: See how different algorithms process data and understand their outcomes through visual representations.
- Experiment with Parameters: Adjust parameters and observe how these changes affect the outcomes, fostering a deeper understanding of each algorithm's sensitivity and behavior.

## Key Features
1. Interactive User Interface: Each module is designed with user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for beginners to start experimenting without needing advanced technical knowledge.
2. Step-by-Step Execution: Users can execute algorithms step-by-step to observe each phase of the computation, enhancing the learning experience by allowing the observation of gradual transformations in the data.
3. Real-Time Feedback: Immediate feedback is provided on algorithm performance and results, helping users quickly grasp the effectiveness and application of each technique.

## Learning Modules
- **Clustering:** Understand how to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Experiment with algorithms like K-Means, Mean-Shift, and DBScan.
- **Association Rules:** Learn about basic association rule mining, which is widely used for market basket analysis, web usage mining, and bioinformatics. This module simplifies the association rules without delving into complex algorithms like Apriori.
- **Classification:** Dive into algorithms that predict the category of a dataset. Techniques such as Knn, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Trees are implemented to classify data into predefined classes.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VuongMinhKhanh/Data-Mining-Project.git data-mining-project
    cd data-mining-project
    ```
2. **Install required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the ChatBot:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
The project's localhost will be shown and you can test out 3 methods with different algorithms.

## Conclusion
Whether you are a student starting in the world of data analytics, an educator seeking comprehensive teaching tools, or a professional looking to refresh your knowledge, this application is designed to help you achieve your learning goals in an engaging and effective manner. Let’s embark on this journey of discovery and mastery in data mining!
